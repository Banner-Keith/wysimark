# Social Expectations

Feel free to use and improve upon Wysimark for both open source and commercial use. Also, feel free to modify Wysimark to suit your own needs.

Working on Wysimark is hard work and we want it to be supported and maintained into the future. A considerable investment has been put into and continues to be put into Wysimark.

One way we can afford to do this is by providing cloud services that integrate with Wysimark.

**As a social expectation, we ask that you don't take Wysimark and sell cloud services for it.**

For clarity, feel free to build cloud services for Wysimark for your own use and for your own application.

That said, we'd love it if we could earn your trust and business by building, offering and operating these cloud services for you or to license the software so that you can use it on your own cloud servers.
