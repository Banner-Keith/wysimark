The world of technology is fascinating and ever-changing. One of the prominent areas that's gaining popularity is [artificial intelligence](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/what-is-artificial-intelligence "IBM's definition of AI"). Artificial intelligence, or AI, refers to the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior.

One major application of AI is in the field of [machine learning](https://www.expert.ai/blog/machine-learning-definition/ "Machine Learning Definition"), a subset of AI that provides systems the ability to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, is making waves. [Deep learning](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/deep-learning "Deep Learning") utilizes neural networks with several layers (deep structures of layers) for analyzing various factors with a structure similar to the human neural structure. 

Another important term related to AI is [natural language processing](https://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/analytics/what-is-natural-language-processing-nlp.html "What is Natural Language Processing?"). NLP involves the interactions between computers and humans using the natural language. The main goal of NLP is to read, decipher, understand, and make sense of the human language in a valuable way.

It's worth noting that AI is not just limited to these fields. There are numerous [applications of AI](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2019/06/28/20-ways-ai-is-improving-our-lives/?sh=48c903d5785d "20 Ways AI is Improving Our Lives"), from healthcare to finance
