Wysimark supports 100% of the CommonMark and GFM Markdown spec.

It's modern, has great usability, and features image and file uploads.

## Design Goals

Wysimark was built with the following goals in mind:

1. **100% Compatibility with Markdown** including the CommonMark and GFM Markdown Spec. It's easy to get the first 90% of Markdown correct and deceptively hard to get the last 10% right.

2. **Modern Design** - A rich text editor with a modern and clean look

3. **Usability** - The editor has to have a beautiful user interface and support both a discoverable toolbar with dropdown menus, keyboard shortcuts to support every feature (also discoverable through the toolbar) and compatibility with Markdown shortcuts like double-asterisk for bold.

4. **Images** - It had to be easy to upload and resize images

5. **Attachments** - Support for uploading files directly into the editor.
