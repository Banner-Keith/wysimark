## The Design Goals

Wysimark is built to have:

1. **100% Compatibility with the CommonMark and GFM Markdown Spec** - Facilitates easy and 100% correct bi-directional conversion between Markdown renderers and text based Markdown editors. It's easy to get the first 90% of Markdown correct and deceptively hard to get the last 10% right.

2. **Modern Design and UI** - Has a modern and clean look and user interface that's easy to integrate with modern web apps.

3. **Great Usability** - A toolbar with dropdown menus with 100% Markdown feature coverage for easy discoverability for users, keyboard shortcuts with 100% Markdown feature coverage and compatibility with Markdown shortcuts like typing a double-asterisk for \*\***bold**\*\* or prefix a line with # for a heading.

4. **Images and Attachment Upload Support** - Easy to upload images/files and resize images with Portive's Serverless Web Component back-end

### Sticky Dropdown Menus with Hints and shortcuts

Menus stay closed until they are clicked open and then they stay open as you hover over other menu buttons. This makes discoverability in menus fast, easy and it works like your operating system. Drop down menus show icons, hints and device operating system dependant shortcuts.
