## The Design Goals

Wysimark is built to have:

1. **100% Compatibility with the CommonMark and GFM Markdown Spec** - Facilitates easy and 100% correct bi-directional conversion between Markdown renderers and text based Markdown editors. It's easy to get the first 90% of Markdown correct and deceptively hard to get the last 10% right.

2. **Modern Design and UI** - Has a modern and clean look and user interface that's easy to integrate with modern web apps.

3. **Great Usability** - A toolbar with dropdown menus with 100% Markdown feature coverage for easy discoverability for users, keyboard shortcuts with 100% Markdown feature coverage and compatibility with Markdown shortcuts like typing a double-asterisk for \*\***bold**\*\* or prefix a line with # for a heading.

4. **Images and Attachment Upload Support** - Easy to upload images/files and resize images with Portive's Serverless Web Component back-end
